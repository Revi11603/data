Brahmānanda: Brāhmaṇa is not to accept any employment.
Prabhupāda: No. He'll die of starvation. He'll not accept any employment.
That is brāhmaṇa.
Kṣatriya also that, and vaiśya also.
Only śūdra.
A vaiśya will find out some business.
He'll find out some business.
So there is a practical story.
One Mr. Nandi, long, long ago, in the Calcutta,
he went to some friend that, "If you can give me a little capital, I can start some business."
So he said, "You are vaiśya? Mercantile?"
"Yes." "Oh, you are asking money from me? Money's on the street. You can find out."
So he said, "I don't find."
"You don't find? What is that?"
"That, that is a dead mouse."
"That is your capital."
Just see. So in those days plague in Calcutta, plague was going on.
So municipal declaration was any dead mouse brought to the municipal office, he'll be paid two annas.
So he took that dead body of the mouse and took to the municipal office.
He was paid two annas.
So he purchased some rotten betel nuts with two annas,
and washed it and sold it at four annas, or five annas.
In this way, again, again, again, that man became so rich man.
One of their family members was our Godbrother. Nandi family.
That Nandi family still, they have got four hundred, five hundred men to eat daily.
A big, aristocratic family.
And their family's regulation is as soon as one son or daughter is born,
five thousand rupees deposited in the bank,
and at the time of his marriage, that five thousand rupees with interest, he can take it.
Otherwise there is no more share in the capital.
And everyone who lives in the family, he gets eating and shelter.
This is their... But the original, I mean to say, establisher of this family, Nandi,
he started his business with a red, a dead rat, or mouse.
That is actually fact, actually fact, that if one wants to live independently...
In Calcutta I have seen.
Even poor class vaiśyas, and in the morning they'll take some ḍāl,
bag of ḍāl, and go door to door. Ḍāl is required everywhere.
So in morning he makes ḍāl business, and in evening he takes one canister of kerosene oil.
So in the evening everyone will require.
Still you'll find in India, they...
Nobody was seeking for employment.
A little, whatever he has got, selling some ground nuts or that peanuts.
Something he's doing.
After all, Kṛṣṇa is giving maintenance to everyone.
It is a mistake to think that "This man is giving me maintenance."
No. Śāstra says, eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.
It is confidence in Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa has given me life, Kṛṣṇa has sent me here.
So He'll give me my maintenance.
So according to my capacity, let me do something,
and through that source, Kṛṣṇa's maintenance will come."
Prabhupāda: Everyone belongs to Kṛṣṇa's family, but we have to see what he's doing for Kṛṣṇa.
Just like everyone is citizen of the state.
Why a man is given high position and big title?
Prabhupāda: Why? Because he's recognized. Sudāmā: Right.
Prabhupāda: So one must give service. Simply to feel, "I belong to Kṛṣṇa's family," and doing nothing for Kṛṣṇa, that is not...
Sudāmā: That's no good. Prabhupāda: That's no good.
That means he'll... Very soon he'll again forget Kṛṣṇa. He'll again forget.
Sudāmā: Actually, the other element is so powerful. These people here,
because, even though they are part of Kṛṣṇa's family,
but because they have forgotten, then we become influenced by their forgetfulness.
Prabhupāda: Yes. Forgetfulness means māyā. Sudāmā: Yes.
Prabhupāda: Māyā is nothing. It is a forgetfulness. That's all.
It has no existence. Forgetfulness, it does not stand.
But so long it is there, it is very troublesome.
Sudāmā: I've been asked a question by some devotees sometimes that they don't feel happy.
So even if they are unhappy, mentally, should, they still should continue in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
I tell them, even if one is unhappy...
Prabhupāda: But you should show example. If you show example different way, how they will follow you?
Example is better than precept. Why you are living outside? Sudāmā: Well, I...
Prabhupāda: (break) ...last time I was so much deteriorated in health, I had to leave this place.
That does not mean I'll leave the Society.
I went to India and recuperated. Or came to London. That's all right.
So health may be sometimes... But that does not mean we shall give up the Society.
If my health is unsuitable here, I go... I have a hundred centers.
And you'll not go out of this universe for your health recouping.
You have to remain within the universe. Then why do you go out of the Society?
(break) ...Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. We have to live with devotees.
Why I left my family? Because they were not devotees. Therefore I come...
Otherwise, in old age, I would have been comfortable.
No. We should not live with the nondevotees, may be family men or anyone.
Just like Mahārāja Vibhīṣaṇa. Because his brother was not devotee, he left him, left him.
He came to Rāmacandra. Vibhīṣaṇa. You know that? Sudāmā: Yes.
Hṛdayānanda: So Prabhupāda, it says that a sannyāsī should live alone, that means, only with devotees.
Prabhupāda: Who...! Where it is said sannyāsī should live alone?
Hṛdayānanda: I mean, sometimes in your books. Prabhupāda: Eh?
Hṛdayānanda: Sometimes in your books. So that means with devotees?
Prabhupāda: In general, sannyāsī may live alone.
But sannyāsī's duty is to preach.
Sudāmā: That I don't ever want to stop. Prabhupāda: Eh?
Sudāmā: I don't ever want to stop preaching.
Prabhupāda: Preaching, you cannot manufacture preaching.
You must do preaching according to the principles ordered by your spiritual master.
You cannot manufacture your own way of preaching. That is required.
There must be some leader. Under the leadership.
Yasya prasādād bhagavat... Why it is said?
Everywhere, in the office, there is some immediate boss.
So you have to please him. That is service.
Suppose in office, in a department there is office superintendent.
And if you do in your own way, "Yes, I'm doing my business,"
and the office superintendent is not pleased, do you think that kind of service is nice?
Similarly, we have got, everywhere we have got immediate boss.
So we must work. That is systematic.
If everyone manufactures, invents his own way of life, then there must be chaos.
Sudāmā: Yeah, that's true.
Prabhupāda: Yes. Now we are world organization. There is spiritual side, and there is material side also.
That is not material side. That is also spiritual side, means systematic management.
Otherwise how it will be done?
Just like Gaurasundara sold the house, and there is no trace of the money.
What is this? He did not ask him, anyone.
He sold the house, and where is the money, there is no trace.
This I am thinking, "American, Indian, Hindu, Muslim," this is all dirty things in my heart.
You cleanse your heart. Hṛdy antaḥ-sthaḥ abhadrāṇi.
The dirty things are within my heart, so if we cleanse our heart, then we become free from this designation.
Naṣṭa-prāyeṣu abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā (SB 1.2.18).
Naṣṭa-prāyeṣu. These dirty things will be cleansed if we regularly hear Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam or Bhagavad-gītā.
Nityaṁ bhāgavata... And bhāgavata means the book Bhāgavata and the person bhāgavata.
The person bhāgavata is spiritual master.
Or any exalted devotee. He is bhāgavata, mahā-bhāgavata, bhāgavata.
So bhāgavata-sevayā means not only reading Bhagavad-gītā and Bhāgavatam,
but we have to study from the person bhāgavata. That is required.
Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised, bhāgavata paṛā giyā bhāgavata-sthāne:
"If you want to learn Bhāgavata, then go to the person bhāgavata who is realized soul."
Not professional. That will not help you.
Official professional - I go to a temple, to a church, and go back again to hellish condition of..., no.
You just associate with the person bhāgavata who is realized soul
and hear from him this the same book, the same knowledge.
Kṛṣṇa's representative. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, tat samāsena me śṛṇu.
Me śṛṇu: "Hear from Me or My representative. Then you will benefit."
So these centers are being opened just to give the opportunity to the people who are suffering
not only in this life, life after life.
ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva
So it is our duty, we have taken this duty on behalf of Kṛṣṇa.
Kṛṣṇa personally comes to teach. Just like He left His Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.
Then He entrusts His devotees to explain to the people in general.
We are attempting to do that. We have not manufactured anything or we have got anything of our own.
The asset and the property is there. We are simply distributing as peon. That's all.
And we have no difficulty.
If we simply present Bhagavad-gītā, the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, as it is, then our duty finished.
We haven't got to manufacture anything; neither we have power to manufacture anything.
Just like there are so many others. They manufacture new type of ideas, new type of philos..., all nonsense.
That will not help. Take the real knowledge.
Interviewer: You came, sir, to this country in 1965, as I said,
on instructions or orders given you by your spiritual master. By the way, who was your spiritual master?
Prabhupāda: My spiritual master was Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda.
Interviewer: Now in this line of succession that we were talking about earlier, this disciplic line of succession which goes way back,
all the way back to Kṛṣṇa Himself, right, was your spiritual master the previous one before you?
Prabhupāda: Yes. The disciplic succession is coming from Kṛṣṇa since 5,000 years.
Interviewer: Is your spiritual master still alive?
Prabhupāda: No. He has passed away in 1936.
Interviewer: So you are at this particular time then the head in the world of this movement? Would that be correct?
Prabhupāda: I have got many other Godbrothers, but I was particularly ordered to do this from the very beginning.
So I am trying to please my spiritual master. That's all.
Interviewer: Now you were sent to this country, to the United States of America. This is your territory. Is that correct?
Prabhupāda: My territory, what he said, that "You go and speak this philosophy to the English knowing public."
Interviewer: To the English speaking world.
Prabhupāda: Yes. And especially the Western world. Yes. He told me like that.
Interviewer: When you came, sir, to this country about 15, 16 years ago and started...
Prabhupāda: No, no, not 15, 16 years. Interviewer: Five, six years ago. I beg your pardon.
To this part of the world, you did not come to a part of the world where religion was lacking as such, you know.
In the United States of America we have many religions, and I think people in this country like to believe,
in great majority, that they are religious people, people who believe in God,
who devote themselves to some form of religious expression.
And I wonder what your thinking was.
What do you think that you could add to the already living religious expression
in this country by coming here and adding your own philosophy to it?
Prabhupāda: Yes. When I first came to your country I was guest of an Indian friend at Butler.
Interviewer: In Pennsylvania. Prabhupāda: Pennsylvania. Yes.
So although it was a small county, I was very much engladdened there were so many churches.
Interviewer: So many churches. Yes. Yes. Prabhupāda: Yes. So many churches.
And I spoke in many of the churches there. My host arranged for that.
So it was not with that purpose, that I came here to defeat some religious process. That was not my purpose.
Our mission is, Lord Caitanya's mission is, to teach everyone how to love God, that's all.
Interviewer: But in what way, sir, may I ask, in what way did you think, and do you think right now,
that the teaching of the love of God which you are doing, is different and perhaps better
than the teachings of the love of God which already were being conducted in this country
and have been conducted in the Western world for centuries?
Prabhupāda: That is fact. Because we are following the footsteps of Lord Caitanya.
He is considered... He's accepted by us - according to the authority of Vedic literature - He is personally Kṛṣṇa.
Interviewer: Which Lord is that? Prabhupāda: Lord Caitanya.
Interviewer: Oh yes. He is the one who came back five hundred years ago to India?
Prabhupāda: Yes. So he is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and He is teaching how to love Kṛṣṇa.
Therefore His process is most authorized.
Just like you are the expert in this establishment.
If somebody is doing something, if you personally teach him, "Do like this," that is very authorized.
So God consciousness, God Himself is teaching.
Just like in Bhagavad-gītā, Kṛṣṇa is God. He is speaking about Himself.
And at last He says, "Just surrender unto Me. I take charge of you." But people misunderstand.
So Lord Caitanya - Kṛṣṇa again came, as Lord Caitanya, to teach people how to surrender.
And because we are following the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, the method is so sublime
that even foreigners who never knew Kṛṣṇa, they are surrendering.
The method is so potent. So that was my purpose.
We don't say that "This religion is better than this religion," or, "My process is better."
We want to see by the result.
In the Sanskrit there is a word, phalena paricīyate. A thing is judged by the result.
Interviewer: A thing is judged by...? Prabhupāda: By the result. Interviewer: Oh yes.
Prabhupāda: You can say, I can say my method is very nice. You can say your method is very nice, but we have to judge by the result.
That is... Bhāgavata says that that process of religion is very good following which one becomes a lover of God.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: In your article in Back to Godhead about Marx, you call him a nonsense, you call Marxism nonsense.
Prabhupāda: Yes, what is his philosophy? Dialectitude? Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Dialectic Materialism.
Prabhupāda: So, we have written one Dialectic Spiritualism.
Hari-śauri: Harikeśa's. Prabhupāda: Harikeśa. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Yes, he read it to us.
He's preaching, I think in Eastern Europe sometimes. We got a report. Has he written you?
Prabhupāda: Yes. I heard that, but is he being alright or not?
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: From the report it appears that he goes occasionally into some eastern European countries.
Mostly he's concentrating in England, Germany and Scandinavias.
He has a party and they are doing speaking engagements and distributing books.
And sometimes he went in which countries? Devotee: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Budapest.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: He is going to some communist European countries.
Devotee: They make their vans with false bottoms and they hide the books underneath so at the border they do not see.
Underneath the van is all your books. When they get in the country then they distribute the books to these students.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Revolution. Prabhupāda: It is very nice.
Devotee: Sometimes he said when he's speaking, the translator will not say what he is saying because it's...
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Sometimes he forgets - usually he speaks very carefully - guarded words.
But once or twice he says, he starts speaking direct Krishna consciousness and the translator looks at him and won't translate it into the local language.
Sometimes he forgets himself and starts speaking about Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and the translator suddenly looks at him. Usually he covers everything.
Prabhupāda: He has done a good job.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: He is a fit person, very intelligent.
Prabhupāda: So in this way... You are all intelligent, you can plan.
The aim is how to distribute books. That is first consideration.
In Bhāgavata it is very figuratively described that we have got this body and the different parts.
Just like Arjuna is sitting on the chariot.
There is chariot driver, there are horses, reins.
There is field, and the arrow, and the bow. They have been figuratively.
So this can be used for killing the enemies of our Kṛṣṇa Consciousness
and then give up all this paraphernalia, chariot, we...
Just like after fighting, only victory, then you kill them.
And similarly this body is there, the mind is there, the senses are there.
So utilize it for conquering over this material existence.
And then give up this body and go back to home.
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Does the devotee, I mean just like you are always enthusing us to push forward...
Prabhupāda: That is sharpening your weapons. That is also described.
By serving the spiritual master, you keep your weapon always sharpened.
And then take help from Kṛṣṇa. The words of spiritual master sharpen the weapon.
And yasya prasādad bhagavata... And the spiritual master is happy, then Kṛṣṇa immediately will help.
He gives you strength.
Suppose you have got a sword, sharpened sword, but if you have no strength, what will you do with the sword?
Kṛṣṇa will give you the strength, how to fight and kill the enemies. Everything is described.
Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu (said) guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya (CC Madhya 19.151),
make your weapon sharpened by the instruction of the spiritual master and then Kṛṣṇa will give you strength, you'll be able to conquer.
This figurative explanation I think last night I did.
Here is a verse, acyuta bala, acyuta bala.
Is Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa here?
Hari-śauri: Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?
Prabhupāda: We are soldiers of Kṛṣṇa, servants of Arjuna.
Simply you will have to act accordingly, then you will finish up enemies.
They have no power, although their number is hundred times.
Just like Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. They have no power, yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ (BG 18.78).
Keep Kṛṣṇa in your side, then everything will be successful. Tatra śrīr vijayo.
Prabhupāda: In India we have been offered so many land. But we have no men to manage.
Svarūpa Dāmodara: I also got a letter from Manipur. That Life Member, Kulavida Singh,
he was concerned that the young people are now giving up the religious thought,
so he wanted to establish some sort of school...
Prabhupāda: That (indistinct) catastrophe is made by Vivekananda, yato mata tato patha, (indistinct).
Svarūpa Dāmodara: So as soon as... They wanted to start an ISKCON branch, and he was a...
Prabhupāda: I think it will not be difficult. Manipur is... Svarūpa Dāmodara: It will be very easy, because...
Prabhupāda: ...Vaiṣṇava. So if they understand, that will be very nice.
Svarūpa Dāmodara: All the, even the government participates. So they wrote me a letter saying that they can give us nice land, plot, and...
Prabhupāda: Oh yes. Now that Govindajī's temple?
Svarūpa Dāmodara: Govindajī's temple is taken over by the government, so I talked to, I wrote a letter...
Prabhupāda: Government, they cannot manage. Svarūpa Dāmodara: They are not managing properly. Prabhupāda: They cannot.
As soon as anything goes to state, especially in India, goes to the government track, it is spoiled.
Government means all thieves and rogues. How they'll manage?
They'll simply swallow whatever they get.
Government means... They cannot manage, they are not devotees. It should be in the hands of the devotees.
So (indistinct), the paid man, they want some money, that's all.
How they can manage temple? It is impossible.
Svarūpa Dāmodara: It becomes a political problem. Prabhupāda: That's all. Eh?
Svarūpa Dāmodara: It becomes involved in politics. So that... Nothing to do with the worship.
Prabhupāda: Anyway, that's why the government should give to the hands of the devotee. We are recognized devotees, ISKCON.
If they want, really management.
We are managing, so many centers, on account of devotees.
It is not possible to manage all these things by paid men. It is not possible.
Devotee: No. Prabhupāda: They'll never... They'll not...
This movement can be pushed on vigorously so long we are devotees, otherwise it will be finished.
It cannot be conducted by any outsiders. No.
Only the devotees. That is the secret.
Devotee: You cannot pay a devotee. Prabhupāda: Eh? Devotee: You cannot buy a devotee.
Prabhupāda: That is not possible. Devotee: You can buy someone to sweep the floor, but you cannot buy a preacher.
Prabhupāda: No, that is not possible. That is not possible.
So so long we remain devotees, our movement will go, without any check.
Devotee: Devotees should take over the world. Prabhupāda: Yeah, that is... That is good for the world. Devotee: Yes.
Prabhupāda: If devotees take up the whole world for management, then everyone will be happy. It is no doubt it. Kṛṣṇa wants that.
He wanted the Pāṇḍavas should be in charge of the government.
Therefore He took part in the fighting. "Yes, you should be the...
All the Kauravas should be killed, and Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira installed."
That He did. Dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya.
Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām (BG 4.8). He wants everything goes very smoothly and people become God conscious.
So their life be successful. That is Kṛṣṇa's plan.
That, "These rascal misleading and their... they got the human life and it is spoiled."
Therefore I was talking about the "What is the meaning of the independence? Dog dancing."
The life is spoiled.
And they will spoil their life and become next life a dog, and this big, big building, will stare, that's all.
What the big buildings will do benefit to these people who is going to be a dog next life?
Taking as a theory, that those who have constructed this big, big building, and next life they're going to be a dog.
Svarūpa Dāmodara: But they don't know that next life they're going to be a dog.
Prabhupāda: That is the difficulty. They do not know it. Therefore māyā.
So try to understand Kṛṣṇa as Hṛṣīkeśa.
So Hṛṣīkeśa, Kṛṣṇa, began to laugh that "He is My friend, constant associate, and such weakness.
He first of all was enthusiastic to ask Me to take his chariot, senayor ubhayor madhye.
Now viṣīdantan, now he is lamenting."
So... We are all fools like that.
Arjuna is not fool. Arjuna has been described as Guḍākeśa.
How he can be fool? But he is playing the part of fool.
If he does not play the part of a fool, how this Bhagavad-gītā will come from the mouth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa?
And because he is devotee, he is perfectly playing in such a way that Kṛṣṇa is giving instruction.
So perfect teacher and the perfect disciple, Arjuna.
We have to learn from their de... Our position...
Arjuna is representing just like ordinary man like us,
and Kṛṣṇa is Hṛṣīkeśa, giving His advice, perfect advice.
If we take, if we read Bhagavad-gītā in the spirit of understanding like Arjuna, the perfect disciple,
and if we accept the advice and the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, the perfect teacher,
then we should know that we have understood Bhagavad-gītā.
By my mental speculation, by rascal interpretation, by showing one's scholarship, you cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā.
That is not possible. Submissive.
Therefore in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said,
tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā (BG 4.34).
So we have to surrender as Arjuna, he surrendered.
Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam: (BG 2.7)
"I surrender unto You. I become Your disciple."
To become disciple means to surrender,
voluntarily accepting the instruction, the advice, the order of the spiritual master.
So Arjuna has already accepted that.
Although he is speaking that na yotsye, "Kṛṣṇa, I shall not fight."
But master, when He explains everything, he will fight. Master's order.
Not to fight, that is his own sense gratification.
And to fight, in spite of he had no desire to fight, that is the satisfaction of the master.
This is the sum and substance of Bhagavad-gītā.
So Kṛṣṇa, seeing Arjuna, viṣīdantam very much affected, lamenting,
that he is not prepared to do his duty.
Therefore in the next verse He begins, that: aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajña-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase: (BG 2.11)
"My dear Arjuna, you are My friend.
Never mind, māyā is very strong.
Despite your being My friend, personal, you are so much overwhelmed with false compassion.
So just hear Me."
Therefore He said, aśocyān: "You are lamenting on a subject matter which is not at all good."
Aśocya. Śocya means lamentation, and aśocya means one should not lament.
Aśocya. So aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajña-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase.
"But you are talking like very learned scholar."
Because he has talked. But those things are right.
What Arjuna has said, that varṇa-saṅkara,
when the women become polluted, the population is varṇa-saṅkara, that is fact.
Whatever Arjuna has said to Kṛṣṇa in order to avoid the fighting, so those things are correct.
But from the spiritual platform... Those things may be correct or incorrect,
but from spiritual platform, they are not to be considered very serious.
Therefore aśocyān anvaśocas tvam. Because his lamentation was on the bodily concept of life.
That bodily concept of life, in the very beginning of Kṛṣṇa's instructions, it is condemned.
Aśocyān anvaśocas tvam: (BG 2.11) "You are lamenting on the bodily concept of life."
Because anyone who is in the bodily concept of life, he is no better than animal.
Prabhupāda: So any question? First of all from audience.
We invite questions, if you have any question, doubt, about the statements, you can inquire.
Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā (BG 4.34). Everything, if you are serious to understood,
we should submit our doubtful questions and then understand. You see. Yes?
Young man: Does one attain a consciousness that is beyond words?
Or, I dare say, is there a communication that is not the word itself but perhaps a vibration,
which is much like sound or sound itself? Perhaps reaching for the oṁ.
Is there a communication, something understood between you and myself,
myself and my brother, others, all of us?
Is there an experience perhaps where we're...
Does it sound like "dong," "aung." Is there something else beside the verbal? Talk?
Prabhupāda: Yes, this Hare Kṛṣṇa. Young man: Hare Kṛṣṇa. Prabhupāda: Yes.
Young man: Could you elaborate? Could you tell me how this can be? How it can be all the time?
Rather than to be a man, rather than to have to talk English alone or other languages? How to talk that one language?
Prabhupāda: Well, sound can be vibrated in any language.
It doesn't matter that Hare Kṛṣṇa can be sounded in Sanskrit only.
You can sound it in English tone also: "Hare Kṛṣṇa." Is there any difficulty?
These boys, they are also sounding in Hare Kṛṣṇa. So there is no difficulty.
It is the sound that matters. It doesn't matter who is sounding.
Just like in piano, if you touch, there is "dung."
It doesn't matter whether an American is striking or an Indian striking
or a Hindu striking or Muslim striking, the sound is sound.
Similarly, this piano, Hare Kṛṣṇa, you just touch it and it will sound. That's all. Yes?
Young man (2): Do you sit and meditate alone?
What do you do with your mind as it wanders? Do you think of something?
Do you put it on something or do you let it wander by itself?
Prabhupāda: First of all let me know what do you mean by meditation?
Young man (2): Sitting alone quietly. Prabhupāda: Huh?
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Sitting alone quietly.
Prabhupāda: Sitting alone quiet. Is it possible?
Do you think it is possible?
Young man (2): If you listen to your own mind. Prabhupāda: Then mind is always acting.
Young man (2): It chatters to you. Prabhupāda: How can you sit, silent mind? Mind is always acting.
Is there any experience that mind is not acting when you sit silently?
When you sleep, the mind is acting. You are dreaming.
This is the action of mind. So when do you find that your mind is silent?
Young man (2): That's what I was trying to ask you. Prabhupāda: Yes. So therefore mind is never silent.
You have to engage your mind to something. That is meditation.
Young man (2): What do you engage it to? Prabhupāda: Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa.
We engage our mind to Kṛṣṇa, the beautiful Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Not only simply engaging the mind, but engaging the mind in action with the senses.
Because mind is acting with our senses.
Prabhupāda: The first scene will be the visit of Vijaya Nṛsiṁha Garh temple.
Hayagrīva: Vijaya... Prabhupāda: Vijaya Nṛsiṁha Garh.
Hayagrīva: I'll get the spellings of these from you later.
Prabhupāda: I'm spelling. V-i-j-a-y N-r-i-s-i-n-g-a G-a-r-h.
Vijaya Nṛsiṁha Garh temple.
This is near modern Visakhapatnam shipyard.
There is a very great Indian shipyard, Visakhapatnam.
Formerly it was not Visakhapatnam.
So near that, five miles away from that station there is that nice temple on the hill.
So I think that the temple scenery may be there, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu's visiting that temple.
And after that temple, He came to the bank of river Godavari.
Just like the river Ganges is very sacred river, similarly there are others, four other rivers.
Yamuna, Godavari, Kṛṣṇa, Narmada.
Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Narmada, and Kṛṣṇa.
These five rivers are considered very sacred.
So He came to the bank of Godavari, and He took His bath,
and was sitting in a nice place underneath a tree, and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa.
In the meantime He saw that a great procession was coming,
and that should be the scenario of this... In that procession...
Formerly the kings and governors, they used to take bath in the Ganges with their paraphernalia,
band party and many brāhmaṇas and all kinds of charitable things.
In this way they used to come to take bath.
So Lord Caitanya saw that somebody is coming in that great procession,
and He was told about Rāmānanda Rāya, the governor of Madras province.
Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya requested Him that "You are going to South India.
You must meet Rāmānanda Rāya. He's a great devotee."
So when He was sitting on the bank of the Kaveri and Rāmānanda Rāya was coming in procession,
He understood that he is Rāmānanda Rāya. But because He was sannyāsī, He did not address him.
But Rāmānanda Rāya, he was a great devotee, and saw a nice sannyāsī,
young sannyāsī was sitting and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Generally, the sannyāsīs they do not chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.
They, "Oṁ, oṁ..." Simply sound oṁ. Not Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Hayagrīva: What do you mean He wouldn't address him because He was a sannyāsī?
Prabhupāda: Sannyāsīn, the restriction is the sannyāsī should not beg from pound-shilling man or see them.
That is a restriction. Women and men of pounds-shillings-pence.
Hayagrīva: But I thought Rāmānanda Rāya was a devotee. Prabhupāda: But he was devotee, but undoubtedly,
but outwardly he was a governor. Outwardly.
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not go him, but he understood that "Here is a nice sannyāsī."
He came down and offered his respect and sat down before Him.
And there was acquaintances, and Lord Caitanya said that
"Bhaṭṭācārya has already informed Me about you.
You are a great devotee. So I have come to see you."
And then he replied, "Well, what devotee? I am a pound-shilling man, politician.
But Bhaṭṭācārya is very kind to me that he has asked Your Holiness to see me.
So if You have come, so kindly, kindly deliver me from this material māyā."
So there was appointment of time with Rāmānanda Rāya,
and both of them met again in the evening,
and there was discussion about, I mean to say, spiritual advancement of life.
Lord Caitanya inquired from him and Rāmānanda Rāya replied.
Of course, that's a long story, how He questioned and how he replied.
Hayagrīva: Rāmānanda Rāya. Prabhupāda: Yes. Hayagrīva: Well, is that important? That's the scene about the meeting.
Prabhupāda: Meeting, meeting, that discussion would you like to give?
Hayagrīva: Well, if it has to be rendered in the scene it's important. You want me to render the discussion?
Prabhupāda: Important is the scene that He met Rāmānanda Rāya, he came in procession, that was a nice scenery.
These things are already complete. Now so far the talks are concerned,
the summary of the talk was... Hayagrīva: Just give me the brief summary.
Prabhupāda: Brief summary. In this scene Caitanya Mahāprabhu became the student.
Not exactly student. He inquired and Rāmānanda Rāya answered.
So the importance of the scene is that Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not follow the formality,
only the sannyāsīs should be the spiritual master.
Anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can be spiritual master.
And to show this example practically, although He was sannyāsī and brāhmaṇa
and Rāmānanda Rāya was a śūdra and a gṛhastha, householder,
still He became like a student and inquired Rāmānanda Rāya.
Rāmānanda Rāya felt some, I mean to say, hesitation that
"How can I take the position of a teacher to a sannyāsī?"
Then Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "No, no. Don't hesitate."
He stated that either one may be a sannyāsī or he may be householder
or one may be a brāhmaṇa or śūdra, it doesn't matter.
Anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can take the place of teacher.
So that was His, I mean to say, gift.
Because in Indian society, it is simply taken that the brāhmaṇas and the sannyāsī can be spiritual master.
But Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "No. Anyone can become spiritual master, provided he's conversant with the science."
And the summary of the discussion was
how to elevate oneself in the highest perfection of love of Godhead.
And that love of Godhead was described, existed, I mean to say, superexcellently in Rādhārāṇī.
So in the bhāva, in the feature of Rādhārāṇī.
And Rāmānanda Rāya, in the feature of Rādhārāṇī's associates Lalitā-sakhī,
both of them embraced and began to dance in ecstasy.
That will be the end of the scene. Both of them began to dance in ecstasy.
Hayagrīva: Rāmānanda Rāya. Prabhupāda: And Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Hayagrīva: All right.
So if we study the character of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa,
then we shall cease to manufacture such words as daridra-nārāyaṇa or this or that.
No. We should therefore never follow this pāṣaṇḍi.
Yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ brahmārudrādi-daivataiḥ samatvena vikṣeta sa pāṣaṇḍi bhaved dhruvam (CC Madhya 18.116)
Pāṣaṇḍi means devil, or nondevotee. Abhaktā hīna cara.
Be careful not to mix with nondevotee who imagines about God.
They do not believe in God actually. This pāṣaṇḍi means who do not believe in God.
They think that there is no God, but they simply say,
"Yes, there is God, but God has no head, no tail, no mouth, nothing."
And then what is God then? But these rascals say nirākāra.
Nirākāra means there is no God. Say frankly that there is no God.
Why do you say, "Yes, there is God, but He has no head, no tail, no leg, no hand"?
So what is there? So this is another cheating.
Those who are atheist, they say frankly, "I do not believe in God. There is no..."
That we can understand. But these rascals, they say, "There is God, but nirākāra."
Nirākāra means there is no God, but sometimes the word is used nirākāra.
But that nirākāra does not mean God has no akāra.
That nirākāra means that not this material akāra.
Iśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇah-sac-cid-ānanda vigrahaḥ (Bs. 5.1). His body is sac-cid-ānanda.
That is completely impossible to see within this material world.
Our body is not sat; it is asat.
This body which I have got now or you have got, it will remain so long this life...
And when it is finished, it is finished forever.
You'll never get this body again. Therefore asat. But Kṛṣṇa's body is not like that.
Kṛṣṇa's body is the same, sat; always the same.
Kṛṣṇa's another name is narakṛti.
Our body is imitation of Kṛṣṇa's body, not that Kṛṣṇa's body is imitation of our body. No.
Kṛṣṇa has got His body, narakṛti, nara-vapu. These things are there.
But that vapu is not like this asat. Our body is asat. It will not stay.
His body is sac-cid-ānanda. Our body is asat, acit and nirānanda - just opposite.
It will not stay, and there is no knowledge, acit, and there is no bliss.
Always we are unhappy. So nirākāra means not a body like this.
His body is different. Ānanda cinmāyā rasa pratibhavitabhis (Bs. 5.37). Ānanda-cinmāyā.
Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya vṛtti-manti paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti (Bs. 5.32).
His aṅgāni, aṅgāni, parts of the body, are described, sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti.
I can see with my eyes. My, this special function of my,
this part of the body is to see.
But Kṛṣṇa: sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti - He can not only see, but He can eat also.
That is import. By seeing, we cannot eat,
but whatever we offer, if Kṛṣṇa sees, He eats also.
Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti.
So how we can compare Kṛṣṇa's body with our body?
But avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ (BG 9.11).
Those who are rascals, they think that "Kṛṣṇa has two hands, two legs; therefore I am also Kṛṣṇa. I am also."
So don't be misled by the rascals, pāṣaṇḍi.
Take as there in the śāstra, learn it from authorized sources, and be happy.
Thank you very much. Devotees: Jaya Śrīla Prabhupāda!
Pradyumna: Translation - "Nārada Muni continued: O King, although the exalted devotee Prahlāda Mahārāja
was only a little boy, he accepted Lord Brahmā's words.
He gradually proceeded toward Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, and fell down to offer his respectful obeisances with folded hands."
Prabhupāda: tatheti śanakai rājan mahā-bhāgavato 'rbhakaḥ upetya bhuvi kāyena nanāma vidhṛtāñjaliḥ (SB 7.9.4)
So Prahlāda Mahārāja is mahā-bhāgavata, not ordinary devotee.
Arbhakaḥ. Arbhakaḥ means innocent child, five-years-old small boy.
But mahā-bhāgavata. Not that because he is boy... Ahaituky apratihatā (SB 1.2.6).
A small child can become mahā-bhāgavata, and a very learned scholar may become a demon.
Bhakti is so exalted that these are contradictory.
Arbhakaḥ. Arbha means foolish or childish, but at the same time mahā-bhāgavata.
It is possible. Mahā-bhāgavata means...
We must distinguish between different types of devotees:
kaniṣṭha adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī and mahā-bhāgavata, uttama adhikārī.
Uttama-adhikārī. So this Prahlāda Mahārāja is mahā-bhāgavatam, mahā-bhāgavata,
not because he is now five years old... No.
He was mahā-bhāgavata from the womb of his mother.
When his mother was attacked by the demigods, arresting, and was being dragged by the devatas,
Nārada Muni was passing there: "What you are doing?"
And "She is the wife of Hiraṇyakaśipu, and she has got a child in the womb.
So we want to kill that child also."
Nārada Muni immediately asked them, "No, no, no, no. He's not ordinary child.
He's mahā-bhāgavata. So don't touch."
So they agreed. Nārada Muni... This is devatā.
Although did some mistake, as soon as Nārada Muni ordered them that
"Don't try to harm. He is mahā-bhāgavata," immediately...
So Nārada Muni said, "My dear daughter, you come with me until your husband comes back."
Hiraṇyakaśipu went to perform very severe austerities to defeat the demigods.
This is demon's austerities.
Hiraṇyakaśipu was engaged in very severe type of austerity.
What is the purpose? Some material purpose.
But that type of austerity, tapasya, is useless.
Śrama eva hi kevalam (SB 1.2.8).
The materialists, they take austerities.
Unless they do that, they cannot improve, either in the business field, or in economic field or in political field.
They have to work very, very hard. Just like in our country,
the great leader Mahatma Gandhi, he had to work very, very hard.
Twenty years in Durban he spoiled his time, and thirty years in India.
I shall say spoiled his time. What for? For some political purpose.
What is his political purpose? "Now we are a group called by the name Indian.
We must drive away the Englishmen and take the supreme authority." This is purpose.
So this is anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ (CC Madhya 19.167). What is this purpose?
Today you are Indian; tomorrow you may be something else. Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ (BG 2.13).
You have to change your body. So what is the next body?
Are you going to be again Indian? No guarantee.
Even if you have got very much affection for India, all right, according to your karma you'll get body.
Even if you get the Indian body of a tree, then you will stand up for five thousand years.
What is the benefit? Kṛṣṇa says tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.
He does not say that a human being is going to be again a human being. There is no guarantee.
Some rascals they say that once getting this human body, he does not degrade. No.
That is not the fact.
The fact is that out of 8,400,000's of different species of life,
according to your karma you'll get a body. That's all. No guarantee that you have...
And even if you get Indian body, who cares for you?
So without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whatever austerities, penances we perform,
it is simply useless waste of time. We should know.
Simply waste of time. Because you have to change your body. Everything will be changed.
You have come naked; you have to go naked. You cannot gain.
Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham (BG 10.34). Sarva-haraś ca.
Whatever you have acquired, everything will be taken away.
Mṛtyu... Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. Hiraṇyakaśipu, whatever he had acquired, Prahlāda Mahārāja said,
"In a second, You took away. So, my Lord, why You are offering me this material benediction? What is the value of it?
I have seen my father: simply by his eyebrows' twinkling the demigods would be afraid.
Such position You have finished in a second.
So what is the use of this material position?"
So therefore those who are pure devotee, they do not aspire anything material. That is not their...
anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu- śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā (Brs. 1.1.11)
We should always remember that. Don't bring any material desire in executing devotional service.
Then it is not pure. Na sādhu manye yato ātmano 'yam asann api kleśada āsa deha.
As soon as you bring in material desires, then you have wasted your time.
Because you'll have to get a body.
Your desire will be fulfilled.
Kṛṣṇa is so kind - ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmi (BG 4.11) -
if you want to fulfill some desire by bhakti, Kṛṣṇa is very kind: "All right."
But you have to take another body.
And if you are pure, simply, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti (BG 4.9).
This is wanted, pure devotee.
Therefore we advise everyone to become a pure devotee.
Pure devotee... This is the example, mahā-bhāgavata.
This five-years-old boy, he had no business except to satisfy, to become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa.
Journalist: Is this what Gandhi did? Prabhupāda: Huh? What Gandhi knew?
He was a politician. He did not know anything about this culture.
Journalist: Well, I read that when he was 36 years old he became a celibate, was it...
Prabhupāda: That is... Of course, he had some Hindu cultural ideas.
That is nice. He began celibacy, that's all right.
But Gandhi had no very advanced spiritual ideas. You see.
He was more or less politician, statesman. Yes, that's all.
Journalist: Yes. A very courageous man.
Well the answer seems very pat, so to speak, and if it's that...
Prabhupāda: Now, if you cooperate, then I can change the whole thing in your country.
They will be very happy. Their everything will be very nice.
This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice. Provided you cooperate. Nobody is cooperating.
Simply these boys, they have kindly come to me and cooperating.
So my movement is progressing, but very slowly.
But if the leaders of the American people, they come and they try to understand
and they try to introduce this system, oh, your country will be the nicest country in the world.
Journalist: You... How long have you been involved with this? Hayagrīva: Two and a half years.
Journalist: Two and a half years? How old are you if I may ask? Hayagrīva: I'm 28. Journalist: You're 28.
Now, has this sort of turned you around? Hayagrīva: Ah, considerably. (laughs)
Journalist: But from a practical standpoint, how is this sexual thing that the swami was talking about, how has this affected you?
Has it, have you found that there is efficacy in that which has been, we were just talking about?
Because to me it's a very paramount problem in terms of young people.
Hayagrīva: Well, there are desires, and we have so many desires.
And the sexual desire is perhaps one of our strongest desires. So...
Prabhupāda: Yes, yes. Hayagrīva: So these desires are channelled so to speak.
They are redirected and they are directed toward Kṛṣṇa.
Journalist: Well, I understand, I understand that, but I'm saying is it efficacious? Does it work?
Hayagrīva: Yes, it works. It works. But you have to stick with it.
It can be very difficult, especially at first, but it works.
You have to resolve to make it work. You have to want it to work.
Journalist: Now, I want to understand this thoroughly.
In other words, it's nothing that you feel that you're giving up.
Hayagrīva: No, it's that when you see something better...
Journalist: That's what I'm... That's what I mean. That's...
Prabhupāda: Yes. You are accepting something better.
Journalist: Better. That's, yes. Not by just biting your tongue or your lip saying,
"I won't touch it, I won't touch it." There is a substitute.
Hayagrīva: It's not, youre not... You have a capacity for enjoyment, and you're not going to give up something...
It's very human not to give up something unless you have something better.
So, the case is that you have to get something better than what you want to give up... Prabhupāda: Yes.
Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ, "I am sitting in everyone's heart."
Find out God, find out Kṛṣṇa. In several places, all Vedic literature, guhāyām.
Guhāyām means in the heart. Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca BG 15.15.
The supreme director, Kṛṣṇa, is sitting there, and He is directing,
"Now this living entity wants to fulfill his desire in this way."
He's giving direction to the material nature.
"Now, prepare a vehicle, body, for this rascal in this way.
He wants to enjoy. All right, let him enjoy." This is going on.
We are all rascals, we are manufacturing our different ways of life.
"I think." So you are thinking. As soon as you are thinking...
But we cannot fulfill our desires without sanction of God. That is not possible.
But because we are persisting, that "I want to fulfill my desire in this way,"
Kṛṣṇa is sanctioning, "All right." Just like a child persists to possess something.
The father gives, "All right, take it."
So all these bodies we are getting, although by the sanction of the Supreme Lord,
but He is sanctioning with reluctance that "Why this rascal is wanting like this?"
This is our position.
Therefore, at last Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-dharmān parityajya, (BG 18.66)
"Give up this rascaldom, 'I want this body, I want that body, I want to enjoy life in this way' -
give up all this nonsense."
So here in the Vedic literatures we find that both the Lord and the living entity,
they are situated in the heart.
The living entity, jīva, is desiring, and the master is sanctioning,
and the prakṛti or the material nature is giving the body.
"Here is the body, ready, sir. Come here."
Therefore the original cause of our entanglement or liberation is our desire. As we are desiring.
If you want, if you desire to become free from this implication of birth, death, old age, and disease, it is ready.
And if you want to continue this implication, change of body, vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni...
Because you cannot enjoy spiritual life in this material body.
You can enjoy this material world with this material body.
And if you want to enjoy spiritual life, then you have to enjoy in spiritual body.
But as we have no information of the spiritual life, spiritual enjoyment,
we are simply desiring to enjoy this world.
Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām (SB 7.5.30), chewing the chewed.
The same sex, the same man and woman, they are enjoying at home.
The same again go to the naked dance. The object is the same, sex, here or there.
But they are thinking, "If I go to the theater or naked dancing, it will be very enjoyable."
So it is called punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām (SB 7.5.30), chewing the chewed.
The same sex life at home, chewing, and go to the naked club, chewing.
Chewing the chewed. There is no rasa.
There is no humor, mellow; therefore they are disappointed. Because the thing is the same.
Just like you chew one sugarcane and take out the juice,
and again if you chew, then what you will get?
But they are so dull-headed, so rascal, they do not know.
They are trying to get the, I mean to say, pleasure which is already enjoyed, which is already tasted.
Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām (SB 7.5.30). Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ
punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām.
A human being... You'll find that when the dogs,
they have sex life, they have no shame.
So, many lusty people stand there and see.
Seeing means they are willing, "If I could enjoy in the street like this."
And sometimes they do.
This is going on. Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām (SB 7.5.30).
Indian man (1): What is the daily income here? They would be interested to know the daily income for their own selves, daily income for the book sales.
Prabhupāda: Oh, book sale? Five to six lakhs. Indian man (1): Okay.
Prabhupāda: You can, you can just imagine from the sales.
Indian man (1): And how many people it must be going. This magazine is hardly one dollar. In America is one rupee.
(Hindi) ...magazine for them.
Prabhupāda: So this is documentary.
And the Europeans and..., they are not fools and rascals that they are interested in purchasing other religious book,
not their Bible. You see? So it has got very great potency.
So under the circumstances, we should now make combined effort that it can be pushed on more organizedly.
I am doing now alone, with the help of these... But no Indians are coming. This is the difficulty.
Ashok Chugani: I think, with all due respect, many Indians are trying to do things in their own villages or in their own districts.
Prabhupāda: Nobody is doing. Ashok Chugani: Well, I mean, if you had been to Bharatpur recently,
about 5,200 beds were there for netra-yajña, for the eyes operation.
Prabhupāda: I know. That I know. But I am speaking of this culture. Ashok Chugani: Culture, yes.
Indian man (1): That is the typical aid one is giving. Indian man (2): (indistinct) ...karma-part, somebody's taking care of. Indian man (1): One cannot...
Ashok Chugani: In bhakti and in... Prabhupāda: But one thing is that we are preaching Bhagavad-gītā as it is.
In Bhagavad-gītā there is no such statement that you take care of the eyes of the people.
There is no such statement. That is your manufactured.
But we are preaching Bhagavad-gītā as it is. That is the difference.
Our preaching is that instead of giving relief to the eyes,
give him relief in such a way he hasn't got to accept any more this body with eyes.
You cannot make a solution of the problem.
Somebody is taking care of the eyes, somebody's taking of the finger, somebody of the hair, somebody of another, genital, and so on, so on.
This will not solve the problem.
The problem is, as it is said in the Bhagavad..., janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam (BG 13.9).
This is intelligence. As soon as you take birth, then you will have eyes, you will have eye trouble, vyādhi.
Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi. If you accept janma-mṛtyu, then between janma-mṛtyu there is vyādhi and jarā.
You have to accept. You may give some relief, but you have to accept.
So that is not solution.
The solution is how to stop this janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi. That is solution.
That is bigger solution. So we are giving that thing - there will be no more eyes' trouble.
The main disease... Suppose one man is diseased,
so sometimes he is feeling headache, sometimes eye-ache, sometimes finger-ache,
and you are applying some medicine for headache. That is not the solution.
The solution is that this man is suffering from this disease. How to cure it?
So Bhagavad-gītā is meant for that purpose. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti (BG 4.9).
And as soon as you accept body - kleśada.
Na sādhu manye yato ātmano 'yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ (SB 5.5.4).
Asann api. This body is not permanent.
So because the body is not permanent, the disease also not permanent.
So Kṛṣṇa's advice is tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.
Mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ (BG 2.14).
You make the solution - that is the greatest solution, that how to stop janma-mṛtyu.
But that they do not know, that this can be stopped.
They are simply busy with their temporary problems.
And they are taking it as very great. What is great?
Suppose if you have got a boil here. Simply by pinprick (makes blowing sound) will it cure?
There must be surgical operation, get out the pus.
So this movement is for that purpose.
It is not for this janma-mṛtyu, I mean, temporary jarā-vyādhi.
That is all right, but Kṛṣṇa says - if we take Kṛṣṇa's advice, Bhagavad-gītā - that is not problem.
If there is little trouble, tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.
Real problem is that janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi (BG 13.9), try to stop it. That is intelligence.
Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya (BG 4.9).
That is culture; that is education - not to be very much bothered with the temporary.
That is not very intelligence. Give them this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
So we have got this body. So long you have got this body, you may give relief to the eyes, but another trouble will come.
It is not guarantee that by giving them relief to the eyes he gets relief from all kinds of disease.
That is go... That will go, going on, janma-mṛtyu..., er, mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya (BG 2.14).
So give relief, and the real relief, how to stop...
That is our Vedic civilization, that you should not become father, you should not become mother,
if you cannot give protection to your children from the cycle of birth and death.
Pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum (SB 5.5.18). This is real problem.
Real culture is that "This child has come to me, so we shall train him in such a way that no more accepting body."
Because as soon as we accept body... It is very difficult subject matter, of course, to understand,
but Bhagavad-gītā teaches, yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati (BG 4.7).
When people forget this problem, janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi,
Kṛṣṇa personally comes to teach them that "This is your problem."
Even if you have got desire to enjoy within this material world, still you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Kṛṣṇa will satisfy you. He'll give you.
There is no need of doing something else for your material enjoyment.
If you want... Because we cannot give up material enjoyment.
We have been habituated since time immemorial,
many life after many life, simply for sense gratification.
It is not very easy to give up the idea.
Therefore śāstra says even if you have got idea of sense gratification, still you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
Don't try it otherwise. Just like the devatās.
They have got facilities for all sense gratification.
Sense gratification means udara-upastha-jihvā (NOI 1),
jihvā, this tongue, and the belly and the genitals.
This is the prime sense gratificatory sources.
Very palatable dishes, fill up the belly as much as possible, and then enjoy sex.
This is material. In the spiritual world these things are absent.
In material world these things are very prominent.
So Prahlāda Mahārāja warns his friends that if we become attached to this sense gratification,
then vimocituṁ kāma-dṛśāṁ vihāra-krīḍā-mṛgo yan-nigaḍo visargaḥ. (SB 7.6.17-18)
Nigaḍa, nigaḍa means the root, the root cause of accepting the material body.
These things are sense gratification.
Tato vidūrāt: from distant place. Tato vidūrāt parihṛtya daityā. (SB 7.6.17-18)
"My dear friends, although you are born of daitya family, I am also born" - his father is also daitya.
Daityeṣu saṅgaṁ viṣayātmakeṣu: "Give up their..." Asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava ācāra (CC Madhya 22.87).
The same thing. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said. So who is a Vaiṣṇava?
Vaiṣṇava, He immediately explained, that Vaiṣṇava, what is the duty of Vaiṣṇava?
Some devotee asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Sir, what is the duty of a Vaiṣṇava?"
So He immediately replied in two lines, asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava ācāra:
"To give up the company of materialistic persons."
Then the next question may be, "Who is materialistic?" Asat eka 'strī-saṅgī:
"One who is attached to woman, he is asat."
And kṛṣṇa-bhakta āra, "And one who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa."
So we have to give up. So there is therefore regulative principle.
At least, no illicit sex. Get yourself married, live like a gentleman,
take responsibility, then gradually you'll be able to give up this sex desire.
Unless we give up this sex desire, completely unagitated,
there is no possibility of stopping this repetition of material birth -
birth, death, old age and disease. That is not possible.
Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja advises, daityeṣu saṅgaṁ viṣayātmakeṣu: "Don't associate with..."
Asat-saṅga, the same thing, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava ācāra.
This is Vaiṣṇava's business. Don't take any opportunity of asat, those who are materially attached.
It is very difficult association.
Then it is possible, upeta nārāyaṇam ādi-devaṁ sa mukta-saṅgair iṣito 'pavargaḥ (SB 7.6.17-18).
Therefore association is very..., sajjati siddhāśaye.
Those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service, make your association with them.
We are therefore making different centers to give everyone the opportunity to have the association of devotee.
As far as possible, we are giving shelter, we are giving prasādam,
we are giving instruction, we are giving opportunity to worship Kṛṣṇa.
Why? Because people may take the advantage of the association, Nārāyaṇa.
Nārāyaṇam ādi-devam, they can associate with Nārāyaṇa.
Nārāyaṇa and anything executed in the devotional service of Nārāyaṇa -
Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, the same category... Nārāyaṇa paro 'vyaktyāt.
Nārāyaṇa means who is..., whose situation is transcendental, Nārāyaṇa.
So as soon as you come in contact with Nārāyaṇa, Lakṣmī is there, goddess of fortune is there.
We are not worshiping the daridra-nārāyaṇa manufacture, no.
Always we have to be engaged in chanting:
Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
so that Kṛṣṇa will save us.
Knowingly we cannot commit any sinful activities. That is one thing.
Unknowingly also we cannot do it. Then we'll be liable.
Therefore if you remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if you always keep Kṛṣṇa within your mind, then...
Just like when the sun is there, there cannot be any darkness.
Similarly, if you keep kṛṣṇa sūrya, the Kṛṣṇa sun...
That is our motto in the Back to Godhead: kṛṣṇa sūrya sama māyā andhakāra (CC Madhya 22.31).
Kṛṣṇa is just like brilliant sunshine,
and the māyā, ignorance, is just like darkness.
But when or while or where the sun is there, there cannot be any darkness.
Similarly, you keep Kṛṣṇa in consciousness always, there cannot be any ignorance; there cannot be any darkness.
You'll be walking very freely in bright sunshine of Kṛṣṇa.
Don't try to make Kṛṣṇa absent. That is Kuntī's prayer.
"My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are going to Dvārakā..."
This is an example. They are not going.
Kṛṣṇa is not going from the Pāṇḍavas.
Just like in Vṛndāvana. In Vṛndāvana, when Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana for Mathurā...
So in the śāstra it is said:
vṛndāvanaṁ parityajya padam ekaṁ na gacchati (CC Antya 1.67),
Kṛṣṇa goes not go even one step from Vṛndāvana. He doesn't go.
He's so much attached to Vṛndāvana.
Then we see that Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana, went to Mathurā.
So how is that, He went so far away? And did not return for many years?
No. Kṛṣṇa actually did not leave Vṛndāvana.
Because since Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana, all the inhabitants of gopī,
they were simply thinking of Kṛṣṇa and crying. That's all. That was their business.
Mother Yaśodā, Nanda Mahārāja, Rādhārāṇī, all the gopīs, all the cows, all the calves,
all the cowherd boys, their only business was to think of Kṛṣṇa and cry.
Absence, separation. So Kṛṣṇa can be felt...
Kṛṣṇa can be present more acutely in separation.
That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching: to love Kṛṣṇa in separation.
Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu in separation: govinda-viraheṇa me.
Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me (CC Antya 20.39, Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam 7).
He was thinking that "Everything is vacant without Govinda, without Kṛṣṇa."
So everything is vacant, but Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there.
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there. That is the highest perfectional...
When we'll see everything is nothing, simply Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the asset...
That is the highest; that is the gopīs. Therefore gopīs are so exalted.
Not for a single moment they could forget Kṛṣṇa. Not for a single moment.
Kṛṣṇa was going in the forest with His cows and calves,
and gopīs at home, they were disturbed in the mind,
"Oh, Kṛṣṇa is walking bare-footed. There are so many stones and nails.
There is pricking Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, which is so soft,
that we think our breast as hard, when Kṛṣṇa puts His lotus feet.
Still He's walking." They are absorbed in this thought. And they are crying.
So they are so anxious to see Kṛṣṇa back home in the evening
that they are standing on the way, on the roof,
"Now Kṛṣṇa is coming back with His..." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is...
Kṛṣṇa cannot be absent from a devotee when he's too much absorbed in Kṛṣṇa thought.
This is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
So here Kuntīdevī is very much anxious that Kṛṣṇa will be absent.
But the effect will be, when Kṛṣṇa will be absent physically,
He will be more, I mean to say, accurately present within the mind of the devotee.
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching is that vipralambha-sevā.
By His practical life. He's finding out Kṛṣṇa. Govinda-viraheṇa me.
Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me. What is that verse?
Cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam, cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam, śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me (CC Antya 20.39, Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam 7).
He's crying like torrents of rain coming out of the eyes,
and He's feeling everything vacant for want of Kṛṣṇa, separation. Vipralambha.
So sambhoga and vipralambha. There are two stages of meeting Kṛṣṇa.
Sambhoga means when He's personally present. That is called sambhoga.
Personally talking, personally meeting, personally embracing, that is called sambhoga.
And there is another, vipralambha. The two ways a devotee can be benefited.
Nitāi: "In this material world, following the path of the pure devotees
who are well behaved and completely endowed with first-class qualifications
due to their having fully taken to the service of Nārāyaṇa
as their life and soul is certainly the most auspicious,
without any fear, and authorized by the śāstra."
Prabhupāda: sadhrīcīno hy ayaṁ loke panthāḥ kṣemo 'kuto-bhayaḥ
suśīlāḥ sādhavo yatra nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ (SB 6.1.17)
So the śāstra says that the association of devotees...
Nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ means devotees.
Nārāyaṇa-para: one who has taken Nārāyaṇa as the ultimate goal of life.
Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu—They are of the same tattva, viṣṇu-tattva.
So people do not know this, that to approach the platform
of worshiping Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa,
that is the most exalted and, what is called, assured platform.
Just like we get insurance, this is assured.
Assured by whom? Assured by Kṛṣṇa.
Kṛṣṇa is assuring, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi (BG 18.66).
Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati (BG 9.31).
Api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa man... (BG 9.30).
So many assurances there are. Nārāyaṇa-parā.
Kṛṣṇa says personally that "I shall protect you."
People suffer on account of sinful reaction, ignorance.
Out of ignorance, they commit sinful action, and sinful action reacts.
Just like a child, ignorant, he touches blazing fire
and it burns the hand, and he suffers.
You cannot say that "Child is innocent, and the fire has burned."
No. This is nature's law.
Ignorance. So sinful activities are done out of ignorance.
Therefore one should be in knowledge. Ignorance of law is no excuse.
If you go to the court and if you plead, "Sir, I did not know that I have to suffer,
I have to go to imprisonment for six months because I have stolen.
This was unknown to me..." No. Known or unknown, you must go to the jail.
Therefore the greatest contribution to the human society is knowledge.
To keep them in ignorance, in darkness,
that is not human society, that is cats' and dogs'...
Because they are in ignorance, nobody can give them knowledge, neither they can take.
Therefore in the human society there is institution for giving knowledge.
That is the greatest contribution. And that knowledge, the supreme knowledge, is there in the Vedas.
Vedaiś ca sarvaiḥ (BG 15.15). And all the Vedas ascertain,
that one should know what is God. That is wanted.
(aside:) Don't make that sound.
Vedaiś ca sarvaiḥ. People do not know it.
This whole material world, they do not know what is the actual knowledge.
They are busy in temporary things for sense gratification,
but they are not aware what is actual the goal of knowledge.
Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum (SB 7.5.31):
the goal of knowledge is to know Viṣṇu, God. That is goal of knowledge.
Athāto brahma jijñāsā. Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā (SB 1.2.10).
This life, the human form of life, is meant for understanding the Absolute Truth. That is life.
And without trying to understand the Absolute Truth,
if we simply are busy how to eat little comfortably,
how to sleep little comfortably or how to have sex little conveniently,
these are animal activities. These are animal activities.
Human activity means to know what is God. That is human activity.
Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ (SB 7.5.31).
Without knowing this, they are struggling for existence.
They want to be happy by adjusting the external energy, bahir-artha-māninaḥ.
And people, leaders, andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ (SB 7.5.31).
Ask big, big scientists, philosopher, "What is the goal of life?"
They do not know. They simply theorize, that's all.
The real goal of life is to understand God.
The Population is Busy Foolish. So We are Creating Lazy Intelligent
Prabhupāda: ...and busy foolish is the last class man.
At the present moment they are "busy foolish."
Tamal Kṛṣṇa: They're worse than lazy foolish. Prabhupāda: Huh?
Prabhupāda: Yes. Lazy foolish is foolish but he's lazy, he'll not do so harm.
But the busy foolish he'll simply create harm.
At the present the population is busy foolish.
So we are creating lazy intelligent.
An intelligent man must be lazy, otherwise how he can act intelligently, sober.
"All right, let me consider."
You cannot hope that the intelligent man will give his decision easily.
Tamal Kṛṣṇa: He can be called lazy, but that's not tama-guṇa.
Prabhupāda: That is sobriety.
Modern tendency is to create "busy foolish." The communists are busy foolish.
If God is All-powerful, Why You are Curtailing His Power, that He Cannot Come?
God comes for two business: to give protection to the devotee and to kill the demons.
So for killing the demons, He does not require to come. He has got immense power.
Simply by His indication, any person can be killed.
There is sufficient power, Durgadevi.
But He comes for His devotee, because His devotee, he is very much anxious.
He is always seeking protection of the Supreme.
So because the devotee will be satisfied by seeing Him, therefore He comes. That is the (indistinct).
Because the devotees are always feeling separation, just to give him relief, incarnation of God comes.
Pralaya-payodhi jale dhṛtavān asi vedam (Śrī Daśāvatāra Stotra 1).
Different incarnations come just to give relief to the devotees. Otherwise He has no business.
There in the India, there is a class of Hindus,
they called so, but actually they are known as Arya-samaj. Arya-samaj.
The Arya-samaj's opinion is, "Why God should come?
He is so great; why He should come here?" The incarnation, they do not believe.
The Muslims also, they do not believe, incarnations.
They also press the same plea, that "Why God should come? Why He should appear like human being?"
But they do not know, neither they can answer this question, "Why God would not come?"
They say that God cannot come.
But if I put the question: "Why God cannot come?"; what is the answer?
If God is all-powerful, why you are curtailing His power, that He cannot come?
What kind of God is He? God is under your law, or you are under God's law?
So, this is the difference between lover of God and the demons.
The demons cannot think. They think that "Maybe there is some God. He must be aloof, formless."
Because he has got the experience of this form: limited.
So therefore Māyāvādī philosopher says that when God comes, the impersonal—He takes the form of māyā.
That is called Māyāvādī. They actually do not believe in God.
Impersonalism, śūnyavāda. Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi.
Some of them are nirviśeṣa: "Yes, there may be God, but He has no form."
And Māyāvādī…Both of them are Māyāvādī, śūnyavādi.
The Buddhists and the Śaṅkarites, so they do not believe.
But we, Vaiṣṇava, we know how the atheists are cheated.
Sammohāya sura-dviṣām (SB 1.3.24). Lord Buddha came to cheat the atheist.
The atheists do not believe in God, so Lord Buddha said, "Yes, you are right.
There is no God. But you just try to hear me."
But he is God. So this is cheating.
“You don’t believe in God, but believe in me.”
"Yes, sir, I shall believe." And we know that he is God. (laughter)
Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare (Gītā Govinda, Śrī Daśāvatāra Stotra 9).
Just see (indistinct).
Under the Influence of Maya We are Thinking that 'This is my Property'
Madhudviṣa: ...one of our very dear friends, Raymond Lopez.
He is a barrister and a visitor who has helped us out tremendously,
with some of the legal dealings that we've had here in Melbourne.
And also this is Mr. Wally Strobes, he has also helped us out and given us good guidance.
And this is Bob Bourne, he is a photographer who has...
He has taken that nice picture of the Deities that I have brought to Māyāpur festival.
Prabhupāda: Oh, yes. Madhudviṣa: Very nice. So he has taken many photographs for us.
And we are particularly indebted to Wally and Raymond
for giving us a lot of good guidance in our dealings with the police.
And one time we had one incident about three years ago,
when some of the boys were a little enthusiastic about Ratha-yātrā festival,
and they went out and they picked many flowers illegally.
So they were caught. Prabhupāda: Illegally? Where? In the park?
Madhudviṣa: No. In one flower-growing nursery. Prabhupāda: Oh.
Madhudviṣa: So they were found out and caught.
But Raymond was able to get them off free due to Kṛṣṇa's mercy.
But it taught us a good lesson.
Raymond Lopez: Actually, I think they had the wrong people.
Prabhupāda: There was a great devotee in South India. He was a treasury officer.
So he took money from the treasury and constructed very nice temple. (laughter)
Yes. Later on, he was caught, and he was put into jail by the Nawab.
At that time the Muhammadan king, Nawab,
he saw in dream that two boys, very beautiful, they have come to the Nawab:
"Sir, what money he has taken, you can take from me and release him."
So the Nawab said, "If I get my money, I can release him."
Then, when his dream broke, he saw the money on the floor, and nobody was there.
Then he could understand that he is great devotee.
He called him immediately, that "You are released, and you take this money also.
Whatever you have already taken, that's all right. And now this money also you take.
You spend as you like."
So devotees sometimes do like that.
Actually, nothing is private property. That is our philosophy.
Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam (ISO 1): "Everything belongs to God." That's a fact.
Under the influence of māyā we are thinking that "This is my property."
Just like suppose this cushion.
Wherefrom the wood has come? Has anybody produced wood?
Who has produced? It is God's property.
Rather, we have stolen God's property and claiming, "My property."
Then Australia. The Englishmen came here, but is that the property of the Englishmen?
It was there. America, it was there.
And when everything will be finished, it will be there.
In the middle we come and claim, "It is my property," and fight.
Is it not? You are a barrister, you can judge better.
Wally Strobes: That was the argument he used.
Raymond Lopez: No, it was (indistinct). (laughter)
Prabhupāda: Originally, everything belongs to God.
So why we are claiming, "It is my property"?
Suppose you have come here.
You sit down for one hour, two hours, and if you claim, "It is my property," is that very good judgment?
You have come from outside, you are allowed to sit down here for two hours,
and if you claim, "This is my property..." Similarly, we come here.
We take birth either in America or in Australia or in India,
and remain for fifty, sixty or a hundred years,
and why shall I claim, "It is my property"?
